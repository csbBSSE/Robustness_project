Continuous_Boolean contains the simulation code for the Continuous model and the Boolean Model, as well as the corresponding discretization code. 
Racipe(modified) has the RACIPE code, as well as the discretization code.
The metrics calculated (PFLs, NFLs, WFLs, PFC, WFPC) etc are found using metric.py in Fig5/Modules
This is applied to study plasticity of EMT_RACIPE(2) perturbations in Fig6.
