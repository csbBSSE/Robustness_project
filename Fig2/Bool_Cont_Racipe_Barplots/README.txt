input directory needs to contain topofiles and ids files.
pass in the network names in the init file.
output has the final probabilities, and also graphs the distribution.
//there are currently some remnants that are useless that i need to clean up.

you just run ./main to run the code, it reads the networks to be simulated from the init.txt file.
run plotternew.py after that to obtain the probabilities(will be put into output folder)
